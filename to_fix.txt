(NEED TO CHECK THE LAST FEW AS WELL)

(things like this)
(OTHERWISE ALL GOOD)

//In parsing:
export T="-n test1 -n test 2"
echo $T, and such
(OTHERWISE ALL GOOD)




//These are all good with valgrind test as well
builtins
c (cmds)
co (corrections)
path
syntax
redirs




NEED TO FIX FROM SEG TESTS
echo seg <> echo seg
